* Document Introduction
  In this document we are working on semantic style sheet portion of
  the renarration framework. We are not including work on renarration
  studio or renararration viewer portals in this document and we are
  also not including work on cloud.

  The scope of this document is only v0.1, which is defined as "V0.1
  play only at node level. Add/del¡­ CRUD on nodes. SSS in v0.1 is very
  simple JSON/XML sheet." The other versions for the SSS portion are
  given in [[index.org][index.org]]
 
* Overview of functionality 
  There are four tasks that should be handled for v0.1.
  + We need to build capability to do CRUD operations at node
    level. This functionality is tilted as "CAPABILITY".
  
  + We need to have a mechanism to use the capability that is defined
    in capability section. We call this "SCRIPTING WORK".
  
  + There has to be mechanism which reads the script and uses the
    capability to renarrate. We call this "ENGINE WORK".
   
  + We need a story that links the engine, the script and the
    capability for a specific application. We call this "PROBLEM
    SPACE".

* Capabilty   
  [[../src/webservices/webservices.org][org file of API's for DOM transformations]]
* Script
  We need to develop a lang for SSS that is similar to CSS but uses the 
  capability that we defined.
  We may need to use preprocessor for converting SSS to CSS for rendering.
  We are looking into "LESS" and other tools...
  See script.org.
  + Style sheet uses API's to create transformation.
  + SS should have a way of linking source DOM to target DOM.
  + SS should contain selectors based on lexicon of the user defined structure.
  + SS may be written in a renarration studio type application. 
  + There could be more than one SS for a given page.
  + Each SS may produce its own variant of the source page.
  + SS can be a "Excel Sheet" with each row being instructions. Each
    instuction can talk about a specific link between source DOM and
    target DOM. There could be many rows of instruction in one
    sheet. Each instruction row may either do a CRUD operations on
    source to produce target.

* Engine
* Problem Space
There are atleast there are two applications that we can envisage
for our renarration work.

** Problem Description - Strip Struct Page
Most of the web nowadays seems to be dynamically genarated by some
backend website applications. 
Eg: Sites include "Amazon","Dictionary.com", "Vlabs".  
Such pages rely on standard templates which contain the core raw content. 
The standard template features include such things as, Navigation info,
ads, Links to FB, Twitter..., Corporate info, Promotional items etc.,
These template features are common across various pages on that site. 
Users who are only interseted in raw content may want to eliminate the
template features and only see raw content transformed to their taste.
In this usecase, we imagine user going to these structured pages, removing
the features of the template item and transforming raw content by changing
lang, currency and units of measure.
 
** Problem Description - Blooms taxonomy

This problem assumes that most pages have lot of good static content 
that can be tagged by blooms taxonomy and subsequently reused to 
produce questions or learning content for user.
For this we assume that volunteer tags static content using blooms
and applications use this tagged content to renarrate page.

** Connecting the dots 
Transformation Engine does renarration on source page to produce a
target page. We are seeing this as source to taget DOM
transformation. To make the transformation the engine requires rules(
Script or instructions ), triggers and tagged content.

[[images/sourceDOM_to_targetDOM_table.jpg]]

The rules are also called script or instructions. They are specific
instructions that do operations on source DOM to target DOM. There
could be many instructions to systamatically alter source to target.
These rules are contained in the style sheet. Rules use API's to make
the change. See script.org.

Triggers can be from user data or enviromental data. Environmental
data includes such things as browser info, date, time etc., . User
info can be such things as user name, user preferences, group
name... which can be obtained during the user registration.

* Tasks to be done
+ Look into "LESS"- this is related  
+ Develop API's - 
  - This is part of capabilty section. 
  - This will be done in stages.
  - See [[../src/webservices/webservices.org][org file of API's for DOM transformations]]


+ Manually tag structured pages for [[http://www.dictionary.com/][dictionory.com]], [[http://www.amazon.in/][Amazon]], [[http://vlabs.ac.in][Vlabs]].
+ Come up with a simple style sheet that can be imposed on manually
tagged structured pages.
+ Automate the reading of the style sheet to produce renarration.
